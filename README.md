### About the Game
This project marks our initial foray into game development using JavaScript. Our aim is to create an immersive experience that encapsulates the essence of our band's theme and aesthetic. Drawing inspiration from the fusion of video game elements and progressive music, we endeavor to transport players into the captivating lore crafted by our frontman, Dylan Tann.

### Game Concept
The concept behind the game draws influence from titles like Hollow Knight, while embracing the unique ambiance of Metora Cliffs, a world of our creation. Expect an adventurous journey filled with intricate level design and storytelling that mirrors the depth of our band's musical narrative.

### Technologies Used
Metora Cliffs is built using Kaboom.js, a beginner-friendly JavaScript library tailored for game development. Utilizing Kaboom.js has enabled us to bring our vision to life efficiently, despite this being our first endeavor into JavaScript game development.
